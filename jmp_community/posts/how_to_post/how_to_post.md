[In JMP Community: Getting correct answers to correct questions quickly](https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discussions/Getting-correct-answers-to-correct-questions-quickly/m-p/550097)


Hi all!

Post by @Landra_C in Getting Started:
[Getting fast helpful answers to your questions](https://community.jmp.com/t5/Getting-Started/Getting-fast-helpful-answers-to-your-questions/ta-p/28583)

I have been mostly answering other peoples questions here in the great JMP community (also have asked for help in some cases!). I just wanted to write a Discussion topic on how you can get help fastest and most likely will have your problem solved (in my opinion). 

### 1. Search community for similar problems to see if your issue has already been solved before 
This is a good place to remind that [JMP is not a spreadsheet](https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discussions/JMP-is-Not-a-Spreadsheet/m-p/214307)
You can try using JMP Community's search with some keywords or use Google Search (I prefer Google Search). For example to look for how to calculate sum with JMP you could search google with: _calculate sum site:community.jmp.com_ to "force" google to make the search on community.jmp.com website.

### 2. Use descriptive title
Descriptive title will guide correct people to your problem faster. Try to be specific but keep it short!

### 3. Explain the problem as well as you can
Try to use simple language. You might know the "language" on the field your question is about, but other community members might not. They might still be able to help you solve your problem or take part in the discussion thou!

From time to time questions ask something and in reality expected to get a result to something else. As an example asking how to calculate Median for data, when in reality you wanted to have median for different groups. Calculation is different in these cases and asking different question that you are looking the answer for will slow down getting answer to your question.

### 4. Show your previous work if possible
If you have already tried some solutions, provide them if possible. 

### 5. Provide example data (and code)
Provide example dataset when feasible. Also if you have a problem with Column Formula or some calculation to columns, try to provide Result column which can be used when testing solutions.
Here are some possible ways to provide data:
* Use attachments in community. You can attach many different types of file types
* Create mockup data with JMP
* Use real data but remember to anonymize it if required. **Also remember to remove data table scripts if they have some sensitive information**
* Provide JSL script which will generate example data. Try to keep script fairly short, as long scripts are difficult to read. If the data creation script gets too long, it is better to attach the datatable

### 6. Provide example of the analysis/graph you have problem with
Try to provide example of the issue you are having.
* If you have a problem with a script -> provide the script you are having issues with (and possible error from Log window)
* If you have a problem with a graph -> provide script to create the graph or an image of the graph you want to have. Even paper+pen version might guide other people to solve your problem

### 7. If you don't/do want scripting solution say so! You can do lots of things in JMP with with Interactive platforms.

### 8. If you get your problem solved remember to accept correct solution (sometimes there might be many!) and give kudos to good posts.

#### 9. Select matching product and labels when possible
